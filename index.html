    <h3><em>About Beat Saber</em></h3>
    <p>"Beat Saber is a virtual reality rhythm game developed and published by Czech game developer Beat Games. It takes
      place in a surrealistic neon environment and features the player slicing blocks representing musical beats with a
      pair of contrasting-colored sabers" - (<em>Taken from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Saber"
          Target="_blank">wikipedia page</a></em>) </p>

    <p>Due to the simplicity of virtual reality and the challenging but rewarding gameplay that Beat Saber has, It is
      one of the most popular VR games of all time. Because of the challenging gameplay the game has it has led to a
      large competitive scene as most rhythm games have.<br /><br /> Because of such a large community, there is also a
      very large modding scene as well. People have modded the game in order to play custom maps. I have also modded my
      game and have gotten quite good at the game as well. I will include a link to replays of hard songs I beat from
      BeatLeader, a ranked leaderboard as well a video I took of a song I played.</p>

      <h3><em>About Red Dead Redemption 2</em></h3>
      <p>"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games.<br  /> The game
        is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption.<br  /> The story is set
        in 1899 and follows the exploits of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, in a fictionalized
        representation of the Western, Midwestern, and Southern United States.<br  /> Arthur must deal with the decline of the
        Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries.<br  /> The game's
        epilogue follows fellow gang member John Marston, the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption." - (<em>Taken from the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2" Target="_blank">Wikipedia Page</a></em>)</p>
      <br /> <br />

      <p><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>(<em>Which from now I on I will abbreviate it as RDR2)</em> is an amazing
        and <strong>beautiful</strong> game.<br  /> The game's graphics are visually stunning and the game still runs
        flawlessly even with max setting.<br  /> I have taken around 70 photos of the <strong><em>gorgeous
            scenery</em></strong> this game has and will showcase them under this paragraph</p>
